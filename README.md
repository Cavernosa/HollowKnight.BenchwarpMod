# HollowKnight.BenchwarpMod

Mod which creates a clickable menu on the pause screen to alter your current bench respawn point. Use warp button (or save and quit) after selection to travel to new bench. By default, only benches visited after installing the mod can be destinations.

Access Benchwarp.GlobalSettings in the save directory and set UnlockAllBenches to true in order to automatically be able to warp to any bench in any save you access with this setting active. Note that this permanently affects the save in question.

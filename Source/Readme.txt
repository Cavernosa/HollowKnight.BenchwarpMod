Mod which creates a clickable menu on the pause screen to alter your current bench respawn point. Save and quit after selection to travel to new bench. Only benches visited after installing the mod can be visited, unless you set UnlockAllBenches to true in the document Benchwarp.GlobalSettings found in the save directory.
